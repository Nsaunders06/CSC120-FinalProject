# SPOILER ALERT
To win the game, players must complete/overcome a series of challenges in each of 3 rooms. In the first room, outside, there are 5 chocolate bars randomly placed around the room. One of these chocolate bars will randomly contain the golden ticket. Once you find the golden ticket, you can open the door to the next room, inside, located at (2,2) in outside, which is the same as (-2,-2) in inside (see map). Next, in inside, there is a pen and a contract randomly hidden/placed within inside. Find the pen, and then find the contract, and sign the contract. Once the contract is signed, the door from inside to garden can be opened. This door is located at (2,-2) in inside which is the same as (-2,-2) in garden. Open the door, and go into garden. In garden, there is a gumball machine at (-2,0). If you chew the gum, game over. There is also a TV Camera at (-1,-2). If you choose to shrink, game over. Finally, a chocolate river runs through the middle of the room at (-2, 2), (-1, 1), (1, -1), and (2, -2). Players can always look around, and if players look around while adjacent to the river, they will be notified where the river is in comparison to them. There is a bridge to get over the river at (0,0). Finally, there is an elevator (like the glass elevator in the movie/book). It is located at (2,1). If you board the elevator, you win!
