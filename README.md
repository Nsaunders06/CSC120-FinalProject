# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 
We created a map that is built of three 4x4 coordinate planes that are all connected. This allowed us to be able to code each individual room and create a project that could be easily added on to. We discussed doing a graph rather than these separate graphs; however, through discussion as a group and with Jordan we were able to come to the conclusion that this design structure was the most effective for our project. 

 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 To start out this project we came up with a concept and planned out our ideas through a slide show. We also watched the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as this is what our game is based on, and noted the elements that we could include. We then took this idea and drew out a map with annotations about what we wanted included. Next, we started coding the individual classes roughly, with the main methods that we wanted to include. We then implemented the game loop and started connecting all of our classes. Throughout this process we continued to go back to our original plan and edit it, in order to make the best game we could while staying within what we knew how to do and could learn. We also utilized peers as a resource throughout the development process in order to receive feedback about the game concept and what people would like.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 Throughout this project we learned how to utilize a game loop and create an interactive interface. We additionally strengthened our coding skills, as this was by far the most complex and largest Java program either of us had ever done. This project taught us a lot, but especially that sometimes you need to step away from code in order to make sense of it.  When coding on this scale it is really important to make sure that you take breaks and loop back as you will catch a lot of errors, as well as be able to make sense of new things. We also learned about how to collaboratively work on code in a git repository which definitely had a learning curve. 

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
We wish that we had implemented our program in a way that would be cleaner and easier to use. Although the code we have is organized, there probably is a way that we could have implemented our program in a way that would require less code and thus be more organized. This would have been helpful through the debugging process as well as the development process. 


 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
If we had had unlimited time we would have added a riddle element. Our original plan included riddles, making more of  a traditional escape room style game. As our program progressed we realized that we did not have the time to code in all the elements to make our program work in addition to writing, and then implementing our riddles.  However, adding these elements could lead to a more interesting game play. Adding audio and graphics could also be a really cool element eventually.  


 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
We think that the most helpful piece of feedback we received was from Ari who took this course last year. She played our game and gave us a lot of good feedback about the actual game and how to improve it, but with an understanding of what we could and could not do, which was really helpful. 

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
If we could go back in time and give advice about this project we would advise that we  implement the game loop a lot earlier. Because we added it late in the process, it felt like a lot of the code we were writing early on was pointless as it was not implemented or running. Once we had a game loop and started to see stuff happening and working, it was a lot more exciting and moved a lot quicker. I would also advise that we donâ€™t spend so much time trying to include riddles. When we were planning our program originally we wanted to include riddles and spent so much time trying to code them in as well as plan them out, that there was less time for us to work on the rest of the program. 


 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
Our team dynamic worked well in this project. Although we are both stubborn and had a lot of ideas, we were able to communicate and provide constructive feedback; pushing each other in order to create the best possible game. It was also helpful to work  as a team because we both had different skills and abilities going into the project. However, we had a lot of git issues that made it more difficult. A lot of the coding ended up having to be done when we both were present and where really only one of us was actually writing, which meant that it was harder to get the project done.
